## 📚 Experience

Previously a Lego addict, I liked building things. When I discovered how versatile and modular computers are, my Lego obsession transitioned to anything tech. As a small child, I would explore and tamper with the internal components of the operating system my PC used to run or of the games I used to play. I used to enjoy breaking them open, analysing how they work and building software from what I learned. Several years later, I got my first job as a [`C++`] game engine developer, but then I transitioned to full-stack, working on various stacks until landing on [`React`] and [`Express`], alongside with [`TypeScript`].
