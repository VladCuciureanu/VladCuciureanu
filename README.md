Hi there! I'm Vlad.

I'm a christian, full-stack developer currently self-employed at [Faith Software](https://faith.software).

On the side I create and contribute to open-source projects that I find interesting.

Feel free to send me an [email](mailto:vlad.cuciureanu@pm.me), find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/VladCuciureanu_), or check out some of my personal projects on my [website](https://vladcuciureanu.com).
