Hi there! I'm Vlad.

My main focus these days is building web products as a contractor.  
In my free time, I'm also working on various personal projects.  
[Check them out below &darr;](https://github.com/VladCuciureanu?tab=repositories)

When I'm not at the computer, I'm usually hanging out with my wife, enjoying a cold brew tonic, or studying audio synthesis.
