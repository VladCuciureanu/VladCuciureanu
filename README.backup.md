## 🤔 Who am I?

&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm a <i>full-stack developer</i> based in <i>Cluj-Napoca, Romania</i>.

 - ✨ I'm a very fast learner and an open-source software creator
 - 📚 Currently, I'm focusing on: [`React`], [`TypeScript`] (sometimes JavaScript 👀) & [`Express`].
 - 💼 Worked professionally with [`Kotlin`] (and [`Java`]), [`C#`], and a bit of [`C++`]
 - ⚖️ Ethos: Passionate about building polished software and web products.
 - 🎯 Strategy: Research first, dive head-first later 🤓
 - 🕺🏻 Fun fact: I dabble in audio synthesis and play a bit of acoustic and electric guitar 🎸

## 📚 Experience

Previously a Lego addict, I liked building things. When I discovered how versatile and modular computers are, my Lego obsession transitioned to software. As a small child, I would explore and tamper with the internal components of the operating system my PC used to run or of the games I used to play. I used to enjoy breaking them open, analysing how they work and building software from what I learned. Several years later, I got my first job as a [`C++`] game engine developer, but then I transitioned to full-stack, working on various stacks until landing on [`React`] and [`Express`], alongside with [`TypeScript`].

## ✍️ Key Notes
